Analyze market trends and conduct surveys to understand the needs and preferences of your potential clients. This will help you identify a niche, such as muscle gain, senior fitness, or prenatal workouts.

3. Choose the Right Platform
Select a platform that offers features like customized workout plans, progress tracking, and client communication tools. Ensure it has a user-friendly interface and integration options for fitness tracking apps or payment processors.

6. Set Up Pricing and Payment Options
Determine your pricing model and set up payment options for your clients. Consider offering flexible pricing plans to attract a wider audience.
